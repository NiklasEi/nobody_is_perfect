# Nobody is perfect | Game for Mini Jam 77

*Theme: Courage*
*Limitation: Game cannot take place on earth*

You play as a triangle that is scared of others it doesn't know. It feels like all the other forms are perfect (circles), only itself has corners.

The core mechanic will be a view field, where the direction is controlled by the mouse pointer and the length by scrolling (looking at the floor/looking up)
